About Me
======

I am a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer graphics & computer vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/) of [GCL](http://gcl.ustc.edu.cn/) from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
